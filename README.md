# 1pagers

A collection of web-based, self-contained "apps" implemented as standalone HTML pages that work offline.

### Table of Contents

- **[Workout Timer](/workout-timer.html)** A simple timer for guiding you through timed Tabata-style workouts. Your computer's voice will announce each exercise and each rest.

### Development Constraints

- Each "app" is a single `.html` file
- Just vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Linking CDN-hosted external libs is ok
- Linking `shared.js` in this dir is ok
- No server/backend (except 100% public, CORS-friendly APIs)
- No compilation or build tools used to develop
- Tested in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox
